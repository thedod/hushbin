h3. HushBin - Tweetable secrets

"HushBin":http://thedod.github.com/hushbin/ is a self-contained single page javascript app for symmetric cryptograhy (RC4, essentially). It also has "pastebin":http://pastebin.com integration.
This enables wide distribution of short-term secrets (gossip, surprise parties, etc.) and can work nicely with twitter and other social networks.

See "demo":http://thedod.github.com/hushbin/ and "documentation":http://wiki.github.com/thedod/hushbin/

h3. Project related gossip

* _HushBin_ was designed in order to be submitted to the "10K apart":http://10k.aneventapart.com/ competition, so I've kept _index.html_ without indentations in order to stay < 10K[1].
  Anyway - now you can vote for _HushBin_ "at the 10K Appart contest":http://10k.aneventapart.com/entry/112

* "*Sealed with a Tweet*":http://swatwt.com is the next generation of _HushBin_. More friendly and less geeky [I hope].
  The project is "here":http://github.com/thedod/SwaTwt/

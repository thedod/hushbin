This is a JavaScript implementation of "ciphersaber":http://bit.ly/ciphersaberarchive that originally appeared as "ubik":http://zzzen.com/ubiklite.html

This version has the following new features:

* Integration with "pastebin":http://pastebin.com (requires some manual copy/paste)

* Nicer gui (working on it, you can help)

* Single file (there's a single occurence of "src" in the file, where we assign about:blank to an iframe)

* Less than 10K. This is because I want to submit it (before 25th of August) to the "10K apart":http://10k.aneventapart.com/ competition. If you contrib, we can submit it together :)

The file _hushbin.html_ is the < 10K file. It's not too minimized and still readable.
There are comments and lots of other slack to get rid of if needed.
_tidy.html_ (about 12K) is the same thing after going throuh <code>tidy -i</code> and is more readable, but the master is _hushbin.html_

I'll add more to this README file (and - of cource - to the wiki) later on.

h3. HushBin - Tweetable secrets

"HushBin":http://thedod.github.com/hushbin/ is a self-contained single page javascript app for symmetric cryptograhy (RC4, essentially). It also has "pastebin":http://pastebin.com integration.
This enables wide distribution of short-term secrets (gossip, surprise parties, etc.) and can work nicely with twitter and other social networks.

See "demo":http://thedod.github.com/hushbin/ and "documentation":http://wiki.github.com/thedod/hushbin/

h3. Project related gossip

I'm submitting HushBin to the "10K apart":http://10k.aneventapart.com/ competition. This means that Whenever I commit, _index.html_ is Less than 10K. This is why it's somewhat minimized (mainly there are no indentations) but it's still readable and somewhat documented :).
_tidy.html_ (about 12K) is the same thing after going throuh <code>tidy -i</code> and is more readable.
